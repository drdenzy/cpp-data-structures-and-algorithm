# 📚 Learn C++ Data Structures & Unit Testing with Google Test

Welcome to this hands-on C++ learning project, designed to help you build a solid understanding of Data Structures and Algorithms—while mastering how to write robust, testable C++ code using the Google Test framework.

Whether you’re a student, a self-taught developer, or preparing for technical interviews, this project offers a clear, practical pathway to strengthen your C++ fundamentals through real-world examples and unit testing best practices.

## ✨ What You'll Learn

✅ Data structures and Algorithm in modern C++  
✅ Writing clean, testable object-oriented C++ code  
✅ Creating unit tests with [Google Test](https://github.com/google/googletest)  
✅ Using [CMake](https://cmake.org/) to build and test C++ projects  
✅ Measuring test coverage with LLVM tools on macOS  

---

## 🧪 Features & Coverage

### ✅ Singly LinkedList Features Implemented:
- Insert at head, tail, or index
- Delete by value or index
- Reverse list
- Detect loops
- Swap node pairs
- Convert binary linked list to decimal
- Deep copy and move support
- Edge-case aware (empty list, invalid indices, etc.)

### ✅ Doubly LinkedList Features Implemented:
- Insert at head, tail, or index
- Delete by value or index
- Reverse list


### 🧪 Unit Test Coverage
✔ test cases across typical and edge scenarios  
✔ Google Test framework integration via CMake  
✔ Optional: HTML code coverage reports via `llvm-cov` and `llvm-profdata`

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/drdenzy/cpp-data-structures-and-algorithm.git
cd cpp-data-structures-and-algorithm
````

### 2. Build & Run Tests

```bash
cmake -DCODE_COVERAGE=ON -B build -S .  
cmake --build build
cd build
ctest --output-on-failure
```

### 3. (Optional) Generate Code Coverage Report (macOS with LLVM tools)

```bash
make -C build llvm_coverage1
make -C build llvm_coverage2
open build/coverage-report-*/index.html
```
